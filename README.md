# 4K Image Upscaler Web App

This project provides a simple Flask web application that lets you upload an
image, upscale it to a 4K resolution (3840Ã—2160), and download the processed
file. Upscaling is handled by the utilities in the `upscaler/` package using
Pillow's high-quality resizing filters.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/) or `pip`

```

## Running the app
